# Practice of Responsive Website

<p>Hello this is a commited change</p>

<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>I was bored, and decided to test my skills on responsive websites (beause i was so bad at it), so i decided to hop on my pc and started coding a website first, it was really troublesome since i was having lots of trouble making media queries (i watched some coding videos for media queries for help) and made this</p>

<h1>Overview of Features:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Navbar</li>
  <li>Main Content & Responsiveness</li>
  <li>Hovering Transition Effects</li>
</ul>
<h2>Navbar</h2>

<p>A nav bar with a text LOGO on top left (since i could'nt find a good logo pngs even after hours of searching)</p> <p> on the top right we have basic navbar options (unordered list flexed into lying down in row), they are actually anchor tags so you can actually use them to go on different web pages, on the top right we have the Sign in Button (can also add a Log in button if you want to) and then finally a grayishh bottom border with a radius of 10% for a fine look! </p>

<h2>Main Content & Responsiveness</h2>

<p>A heading with 2 span tags to give the "coolest" text one a different color while the other "responsive" text one would change its color when the user switches to mobile mode (600px width) and the heading would go into centered text mode to give more freshing look</p>

<p>The Navbar's List dissapears when entered in mobile mode (for now i havnt add any feature for expanding it by clicking or hovering) but i believe that it can be done easily with Javascript</p>

<p>A button (with the same styles of sign in button) centered when changed to mobile mode</p>

<p>finally the picture which i find on Freepik because it matched with the website's theme (i dont own it okay? if you are the owner, thank you!)</p>

<h2>Hovering Transition Effects</h2>
<h3>I wasnt actually planning on doing this, but my productivity was really high</h3>
<p><b>Navbar's lists </b> changes their color within a duration of 1 second when hover (which looks really satisfying)</p>
<p><b>Green buttons </b> also changes their colors when hovered</p>

<h2>Heres How it looks (for those who are too lazy to open the website on their own xD)</h2>

<h3>PC mode:</h3>
